Super Mario Bros game remade by me. In the About section, the rules of the game are written. You can click on the section and read them

There are 2 types of enemies in the game: 1. This is the one that moves on the ground, it's really funny;
2. This is the one that guards the heavens, a turtle with krills, why not?
